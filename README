A collection of useful python scripts used for text processing and parsing.
* BeautifulSoup
* html2plaintext

Grouped together for easy deployment on django and useful for other django apps that depend on these text processing capabilities.

It is noted that we can install BeautifulSoup using our linux package manager of via PIP/Virtualenv too; however, the objective of creating this standalone django app is to make it easy for these Python Libraries to work together with in-built Django functionality, in particular, the modification in html2plaintext to use django.utils.safestring and django.utils.unicode modules.
